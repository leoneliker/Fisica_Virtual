# Fisica_Virtual
A investigation project written during my high school stage. As you can read behind on the abstract, this is a project where i did some physics experiments on Unreal Engine 4.
If you want the file with the experiments, contact with me.

It is important to know, that the whole project was written in spanish.


## Abstract
Computing is called to be one of the great bases of our future society, thanks to the possibility of studying any scientific field by simulating it on a computer.
To know the current state of the simulation, different concepts such as physics, video game engines and the necessary tool for its use will have been explained previously. Next, the engine you which we will refer to when verifying the issue, will be explained. Finally, different experiments will be carried out in order to check this.
Through this project, it will be possible to know the possibility of carrying out the different experiments on a computer or not, greatly facilitating the study and a hypothesis quite close to what will happen in a few years can be launched.
